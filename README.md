# Analysis of Euston to Manchester Train Route Performance

## Project Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of the operational performance of Avanti West Coast's Euston to Manchester service. The goal is to identify and understand the primary causes of delays and poor performance, with recommendations for enhancing service efficiency.

## Key Objectives
- Evaluate the punctuality and operational performance of the Euston to Manchester route from 2017 to 2024.
- Identify the main causes of delays and disruptions.
- Offer actionable recommendations to improve train service performance.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling of missing values, data extraction using Python and R, and segmentation analysis.
- **Performance Analysis:** Comparative analysis of Avanti West Coast against other operators, including statistical tests and graphical representations.
- **Cause Identification:** Investigation of specific causes of service disruptions and identification of responsible entities.

## Insights and Findings
- **Punctuality Analysis:** Investigated whether Avanti West Coast trains experience higher delays compared to other operators.
- **Route Differentiation:** Examined different routes to identify which have the highest delays impacting Avanti West Coast's performance.
- **Cause Analysis:** Focused on identifying key factors and locations responsible for service disruptions, with a detailed look at the Euston-Manchester route.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python, R
- **Tools:** Excel, CSV, graphical data presentation tools.

## Conclusions
The analysis highlights significant areas for improvement, particularly in managing boarding times and addressing subsequent delays efficiently. The study also suggests increasing the number of trains during peak times and enhancing real-time train tracking to mitigate delays effectively.

## Future Work
- Refinement of data preprocessing techniques.
- Expansion of analysis to include additional performance metrics and more comprehensive time frames.
- Collaboration with service providers to implement suggested improvements.
